# Uncrambling-Word-Game---Python


# Designed a class and different functions to create buttons for the user to play a game  
# Produced a function to open a file of a list of words, scrambled the words and shuffled as well 
# Allowed the user to guess a scrambled word
# Gives the user points if right and allows up until 3 guesses if it is wrong 
# Once the word in the file is guessed or even not guessed, after 3 tries, the program moves onto the next word
